    <p>Radio spectrum is a limited natural resource under a significant demand and thus, must be effectively monitored and protected from unauthorized access. Recently, there has been a significant interest in the use of inexpensive commoditygrade spectrum sensors for large-scale RF spectrum monitoring. These sensors being inexpensive can be deployed at much higher density, and thus, can provide much more accurate spectrum occupancy maps or intruder detection schemes. However, these sensors being inexpensive also have limited computing resources, and being independent and distributed can suffer from clock skew (i.e., their clocks may not be sufficiently synchronized). In this paper, we are interested in the problem of detection and localization of multiple intruders present simultaneously, in the above context of distributed sensors with limited resources and clock skew. The key challenge in addressing the intruder localization problem using sensors with clock skew is that it is very difficult to even derive an observation vector over sensors, for any (absolute) instant. In this work, we propose Group-Based Algorithm, a skew-aware multiple intruders localization method that essentially works by extracting observations across sensors for certain small sets of transmitters. Our results show that Group-Based Algorithm yields significant improvement of accuracy over relatively simpler approaches.</p>

    <p>RF spectrum is a limited natural resource under a significant demand and thus must be effectively monitored and protected. Recently, there has been a significant interest in use of small inexpensive spectrum sensors for large-scale RF spectrum monitoring. The spectrum sensors are attached to compute devices for signal processing computation and also network and storage support. However, these compute devices are very resource limited in terms of hardware, and thus the sensing parameters used in general, cannot be directly applied as is. To demonstrate this, we consider detecting an unauthorized transmitter that transmits intermittently for very small durations (micro-transmissions) as an example application. We quantify the impact of device hardware and crucial sensing parameters such as sampling rate, integration size and frequency resolution in detecting such transmissions. We find that we cannot detect more than 45% of micro-transmissions on these inexpensive spectrum sensors. To counter this, we show that almost all the micro-transmissions can be detected by deploying more sensors in a given location and fusing the data from multiple sensors.</p>

    <p>A large fraction of users in developing regions use relatively inexpensive low-end smartphones. However, the impact of device capabilities on the performance of mobile Internet applications has not been explored. In order to bridge this gap we study the QoE of three popular applications: Web browsing, video streaming, and telephony, for different device parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Web applications are much more sensitive to low-end hardware compared to video applications, especially video streaming. This is because the video applications exploit specialized coprocessors/accelerators and thread level parallelism on multi-core mobile devices. Even low-end devices are equipped with coprocessors and multiple cores. Whereas, Web browsing is largely influenced by clock frequency and uses no more than 2 cores. This makes Web browsing more vulnerable to performance on low-end smartphones. Based on the lessons learnt from studying video applications, we explore offloading Web computation to a co-processor. Specifically, we explore offloading of regular expression computation to a DSP coprocessor and show an improvement of 18% in page load time while saving the energy by a factor of 4.</p>

    <p>Mobile video traffic is dominant in cellular and enterprise wireless networks. With the advent of myriads of applications from video telephony and streaming to virtual reality, network administrators face the challenge to provide high quality of experience (QoE) in the face of diverse wireless conditions and application contents. Yet, state-of-the-art networks lack analytics for QoE, as this requires support from the application or user feedback. While there are existing techniques to map quality of service (QoS) to QoE by training machine learning (ML) models without requiring user feedback, these techniques are limited to only few applications (e.g., Skype), due to insufficient QoE ground-truth annotation for ML. To address these limitations, we focus on video telephony applications and model key artefacts of spatial and temporal video QoE. Our key contribution is designing content- and device-independent metrics and training across diverse WiFi conditions. We show that our metrics achieve a median 90% accuracy by comparing with mean-opinion-score (MOS) from more than 200 users and 800 video samples. Our content-independent metrics significantly reduce the MOS prediction error of previous works and are validated over three popular video telephony applications - Skype, FaceTime and Google Hangouts.</p>
