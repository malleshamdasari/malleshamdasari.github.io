<h2>University Statement</h2>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p> 
A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the mission of Northeastern Uni-versity. The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University. 
</p>

<p> 
As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and respon-sibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern Uni-versity expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assign-ments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors.
