<h1>Life</h1>

<p>
I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.onefivenine.com/india/villages/Karimnagar/Mallial/Ramannapet" target="_blank">Ramannapet</a>, a beautiful village in south-central India with a population of roughly two thousand people. Telugu is the spoken language. It is the kind of place where nearly everyone knows one another. It has a thick culture of its own that the world has no idea about, which I hope to share to the world one day.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Growing up, the village functioned almost as a self-sustained ecosystem. Most families depended on farming. Local elders helped resolve conflicts, with almost no government involvment. It was almost a barter system if I remember. Travel often meant ox carts along dusty or muddy roads.
</p> --!>

<p>
I spent much of my childhood on our farm fields, an experience I would never trade.
</p>

<p> <br>
I was fortunate to attend a government middle school in the village, and a high school in a nearby town. Then I got to go to Osmania University in Hyderabad, for college, a rare opportunity for people in villages like ours.
</p>

<p>
I then crossed the ponds to pursue graduate studies in the United States. A country that welcomed me with generosity and opportunity. Within months, it began to feel like home. It was especially because I lived in rural Missouri (Rolla) for the first six months, which had a lot of resemblence with rural India that made me feel home.
</p>

<p>
Much of my life has been shaped by the mentorship of people who, often without obligation, chose to invest their time and belief in me. I understand how extraordinary such guidance can be. I hope, in my own way, to offer that same encouragement to others.
</p>

<p>
I find myself drawn not only to scholarly pursuits but also to broader questions related to humanity such as the gaps between rural and urban perspectives, disparities in education, economic inequality, human dignity, and opportunity. These concerns may be wide-ranging, but I have come to believe that human lives are not meant to be one-dimensional. Depth matters, but so does breadth, and sometimes the most meaningful contributions emerge at the intersections. I do understand that it is incredibly difficulty to make sense of these abstract problems, but I think it's a good start to think and try to understand the problems at first.
</p>

<p>
In spare time, I spend time reading nonfiction, writing small notes, and reflecting on how our world came to be, and how we might carry it forward with greater thoughtfulness. I practic calisthenics as an amateur. I am also currently learning (although at very slow pace) two foreign languages: Russian and Hindi.
