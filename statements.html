    What is unfolding in Minneapolis is heartbreaking.
  </p>

  <p>
  America has long presented itself as an advanced civilization and the leader of a free world. Today, it finds itself at a moral crossroads.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two innocent people are killed. Renee Good. Alex Pretti. 
    Two human beings with lives, families, and futures that ended abruptly and violently. In moments like this, the most painful part is not only the loss itself,
    but how quickly we try to move past it, and how easily grief is replaced with justification, and sorrow with silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am writing this to my academic community because we carry a great responsibility that goes beyond our work.
    We shape minds. We model values. We help define progress. And progress cannot mean becoming numb to violence
    or learning to rationalize cruelty.
  </p>

  <p>
    We should not be silent. Silence does not mean neutrality, it means acceptance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, we can choose a different path. We can acknowledge the pain, sorrow, and fear being felt right now.
    We can lead peacefully, by encouraging empathy, insisting on accountability, and working to make our communities safer.
    We can treat one another with dignity and respect, remembering that before anything else, we are human.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not about politics. It is not about parties, policies, or ideology. It is about human decency.
    When innocent lives are taken, the only honest response is to mourn. To pause. To feel the weight of what has been lost.
    Anything less diminishes us. Under no circumstance should we allow governments, leaders, institutions, or policies to divide us from that truth.
    We cannot move forward by excusing violence. We cannot call ourselves civilized while defending cruelty.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
    Behind every loss is a life that mattered. If we cannot mourn innocent lives together,
    then we have already lost something far more precious than safety, we have lost our humanity.
